1. Run site transformation.py to get the 'site transformation.npy' file
2: Run newphase.py to get the 'newket.npy' and the 'phase.npy' files
3: Run the newumatrix.py to get the umatrix.

Extra files:
In order to run the above three files, you also need some extra files.
1: "symm_elem.3.tsv" and "16_positions.tsv" for the site transformation.py file
2: "site transformation.npy"(generated by the first step) and "16_positions.tsv" for the newphase.py file
3: "newket.npy" and "phase.npy"(both generated from the second step), "g1.npy" to "x4.npy" and "effect_op2.tsv" for the newumatrix.py file
